###  Conclusion
This is an Recipe Management API project that consists of many entities:  User, Post,Comment,Recipe .
To perform any operation on this project the User must be registered .From this project a Registered User can do the CRUD operations with the entities like add Recipes,delete recipes, Update recipes, add post of Recipes, update Post , get Post, Delete Post and can comments on the posts.
In this project I used passwordEncryptor which save the password in database in hashCode.
This Project provide a email Authentication when a user sign in his Account , a Token received that user mail.This Token will be valid when till user is sign in his Account after sign out the token will be expired.
With the help of token the valid user can do CRUD operations .
The project utilizes different types of mappings between these entities to establish relationships and functionality within the system.
And unregistered User can't do antthing.
This project workes very effecient and fast.
And this is User friendly any user can use easily.
